# Image Classification using Adam-Optimized Neural Network

## Overview
A robust image classification system implemented using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Adam optimization. This implementation provides high accuracy and efficient training through adaptive moment estimation, making it suitable for various image classification tasks.

## Features
- **Adam Optimization**: Implements adaptive moment estimation for efficient gradient descent
- **Customizable Architecture**: Easily modifiable neural network layers and parameters
- **Data Augmentation**: Built-in image augmentation for improved model generalization
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Training progress visualization and metrics tracking
- **Model Checkpointing**: Automatic saving of best model weights during training
- **Inference Pipeline**: Ready-to-use inference scripts for new images
